# thermostat

Reverse engineering an ESi Centro thermostat.

Taking inspiration from:

- [esi-controls Python library](https://github.com/josh-taylor/esi)
- Decompiled ESi app [from APK Pure](https://apkpure.com/esi-centro/cn.com.esi.homes/) using [jadx](https://github.com/skylot/jadx)

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run start
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.15. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
